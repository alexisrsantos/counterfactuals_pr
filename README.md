# Santos-Lozada and Howard 95% C.I. for the Estimate
Due to some questions presented by other researchers we are sharing the document titled **Derivation of our calculations for intervals around excess death estimates** which we satifies the multiple requests we have recieved to justify the narrow ranges around our central estimate of 1139 excess deaths. 

The file can be accessed here: [Explainer](Santos_Howard_95RangesforEstimate.pdf).
